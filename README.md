The purpose of the project
This programming project develops a command-line application for creating, storing, and managing recipes using object-oriented principles. 
In part 1, users can enter a single recipe's ingredients, quantities, units, and steps, scaling quantities as needed. 
In part 2 the application then extends to support multiple recipes with names, displaying them alphabetically. 
Users can track nutritional information like calories and food groups per ingredient. 
The application calculates total calories, notifying users if exceeding 300. 
Key requirements include using classes, generic collections, delegates for calorie notification, unit testing and Git version control with a GitHub repository.

Feedback 
I fixed my README so that it had more detail. I also added better error handling for part 2 of the code. 
The README now provides comprehensive explanations and clear guidance, making it easier for users to understand the project's purpose, structure, and functionality. 
The improved error handling ensures the application can gracefully handle and recover from a wider range of potential errors, leading to more robust and reliable execution.
Made the format better as well as added colored text display. 
I refined the overall format and presentation, adhering to best practices for improved readability and maintainability. 
The colored text displays makes it look visually appealing but i also not used to much.
With these changes, the project now has a more user-friendly and informative README, better error handling capabilities and avisually enhanced codebase. 
These improvements contribute to a better overall experience for users and developers, this helps with easier comprehension.

Major Changes Made

Users are now able to enter an unlimited number of recipes.
Users can enter a name for each recipe.
Listed recipes are displayed alphabetically by name.
Users can choose which recipe to display.
Users can enter the calories and food groups for each ingredient.
The user is notified when the total calories exceed 300 in a red pop up message.

Additional Information
The application is built using c# and net 4.8
